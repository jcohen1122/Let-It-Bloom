# Let-It-Bloom
TAMID S'22 Project

Working with BlooMap, an Israeli start-up company, the Let it Bloom team completed three phases to build up their back-end.

BlooMap is a company utilizing an AI engine to provide users with the plants compatable with their garden based off of their environmental conditions.

<h3>Phase 1 - Koppen Geiger Climate Zones</h3>
We were given text files containing coordinates and climate zones for each of five climate forecast models, and were tasked with converting each file to a CSV.

<b>Files</b> <br>
Code: Koppen_Geiger.ipynb <br>
Deliverable: Koppen Geiger Deliverable.docx

<h3>Phase 2 - Plant Hardiness Zones</h3>
We were given a CSV file containing zip codes and plant hardiness zones, and we were tasked with converting each zip code to coordinates and matching the plant hardiness zones with the climate zones from Phase 1. Then, we would compute the Plant Hardiness zone makeup of each Climate Zone.

Code: Plant_Hardiness.ipynb <br>
Deliverable: KG-PH Analysis.xlsx

<h3> Phase 3 - Plant Web Scraping</h3>
We were given a website containing 1000+ plants and relevant information about each. We were then tasked with compiling all of the plants and their data into a CSV file, which included plant hardiness zones, allowing the plants to be matched with data from the first 2 phases.

Code: Plant_List.ipynb <br>
Deliverable: Final_Plant_List.csv

<h3>Deliverables</h3>

All data files and code were sent to the Point of Contact, and a final presentation was created and presented to the entire TAMID chapter and the Dean of the Business school.
